## Asked Questions!

"I get an error when i try running the file"

To fix this, go to your file explorer, find "ponytown.py" and right click on it, click properties, copy the location. (it must be something like C:\Users\Username\Download) and go to your terminal again, type "cd" and paste the location of the file that you copied and type "python ponytown.py" again. This should fix it.

"Do i have to keep Pony Town on my screen?"

Yes, you have to.

"How often does it refresh?"

When you run the file, it asks you that. I would recommend to answer with higher numbers. But it doesnt matter that much.

And you dont have to play in the web version, you can do it with you downloaded app. (Dont misunderstand this, it does NOT work for mobile. I can make something for mobile soon if i dont get lazy.
